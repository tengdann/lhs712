38	. Per APS: "On evaluation, patient notes life-long h/o anxiety, that often worsens in the setting of changes in her personal life. Recently she notes she has been working more, and also that she found out that her ex-boyfriend has been seeing someone new. She also describes recurrent issues with medications (mood lability, sedation, etc), and that recently her buspirone has been titrated up to 30mg (from 20mg QHS). She does note some "fogginess" in this context as a most prominent side effect. Mood has been "all over" and she denies consistent and persisting 2+ weeks of primarily depressive or elevated mood. She does have days when she feels depressed, which she attributes to anxiety. On those days, her sleep will be poor (often wakes up early with severe anxiety), appetite is poor (she may vomit when stressed), interests/energy can be poor. No frank anhedonia, or guilt noted. When acutely anxious she can feel so overwhelmed that she feels hopeless. Panic attacks in addition to daily anxiety noted. She describes last such episode last night, eventually culminating in such severe mood lability that she thought fleetingly of overdosing on medications. She was afraid of these thoughts, and strongly denies wanting to overdose or actual intent. She told her friend/roommate, and also told her therapist in the am, which eventually prompted her presentation here. She currently denies all SI/intent or plan, and finds she can continue to do well in the outpatient setting. She is amenable to outpatient supports, including referral to urgent care clinic here for bridge appts and/or PHP/IOP through Medial. Collateral obtained from patient's therapist (979-538-7726) - she confirms the history as noted above. She saw the patient for follow up today, and encouraged her to self-present to the ED for safety evaluation. She does not find that patient would likely act on her SI, but does agree that she'd likely benefit from increased outpatient supports. Confirmed w the therapist that the patient is losing access to her psychiatrist and has no f.u scheduled. Also, the therapist raised some concern whether the mood lability may be due to recent up titration of buspirone. She can see the patient on 8/17/79 at 3pm or 7pm. "

78	: Ms. Keller is a 62-year-old woman with a history of bipolar affective disorder, type 1, numerous prior hospitalizations (most recently in August 1984 at Seaside), five prior suicide attempts by overdose, significant history of abuse and trauma, and medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's disease, hypertension, and hyponatremia, who presents for continued management of her psychiatric medications.  On our initial meeting she appears hyperthermic but consistent with her baseline per signout from previous treaters.  Her history is consistent with bipolar disorder with psychotic features vs. schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.  Although she is at chronically elevated risk for self-harm given her previous suicide attempts, severe mental illness, impulsivity, and personality vulnerabilities, she currently appears to be at her baseline and these risk factors are mitigated by her help-seeking behavior, close support from a multidisciplinary team, plan for individual dispensation of medications by her VNA, and safety plan.  She is therefore appropriate for continued outpatient treatment.Substance Use Intervention Action Plan: None needed

263	" In an effort to seek treatment, she began seeing dietician, Frida Gibbons in Hubert, who she states was "helpful, but not enough."  She subsequently purchased a diet book and worked through the exercises in the book and states that that, too, was helpful, but not enough.  She ultimately contacted one of the authors of the book and arranged to undergo therapy with her via Skype.  She states that that was helpful for approximately 6-months, at which time her therapist suggested that she seek local ED-specific care.  As such, she underwent an evaluation with Dr. Deon Yarbrough 6/2006 and was subsequently referred to Dr. Tonya Alston for a 20-week course of CBT-E.  Valentina states that her treatment with Dr. Alston was "phenomenal...it was exactly what I needed."  She concurrently began seeing Dr. Yvonne Ellison for psychopharmacologic treatment of her underlying depressive/anxiety disorder and BED.  She has since responded well to her current regimen of Zoloft, Vyvanse, and Topamax.

He remembers being on the ground on all four seconds later, talked with the van driver, went home. Later on he felt sick, nauseous, had a headache, kind of like being hung over, went to a concert, was irritable. The following day he started getting a throbbing headache, felt fatigued, had difficulty writing and reading. When driving, everything was too slow. After a few days he went to Zumbrota Hospital ER, was told he had a concussion. He did vestibular therapy which helped his nausea. He tried studying at Tianjin but had constant headaches and fatigue. In the last couple of months, he still has headaches over his forehead and over his eyes, the pain is dull, deep, squeezing, sometimes pulsating, is aggravated by light, or effort. He has headaches all the time with intensity varying between 2 and 8/10. He takes Tylenol when the headache is worse. He feels fatigued most of time - after trying to read, going for a walk, taking half of a neuropsychological examination. He feels physically sick. He still gets nausea but that is better.
